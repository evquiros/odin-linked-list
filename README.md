# Linked List Implementation

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum under the **JavaScript Path**. It focuses on understanding and implementing **Linked Lists** in JavaScript, emphasizing their structure, operations, and applications.

## Overview

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are connected using pointers. Each node contains:

1. **Value**: The data stored in the node.
2. **Next**: A reference (pointer) to the next node in the list.

The goal of this project is to implement a **singly linked list** in JavaScript, learning key concepts and operations associated with linked lists.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure of linked lists and how they differ from arrays.
- Implement key operations:
  - Adding elements to the list.
  - Removing elements.
  - Searching for elements.
  - Traversing the list.
- Apply the **Node** and **LinkedList** classes to manage the data structure.

## Key Concepts

- **Node Class**: Represents individual elements in the list. Each node holds data and a reference to the next node.
- **LinkedList Class**: Manages the linked list, handling operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
